//Inheritance
I used the same classes and functions I used in the previous lab with encapsulation, but also added the class named CoffeeShop, as the parent of all others.
The second level are Characters(with the attributes name and role, also, every role has a separated message, the methods messRole(), mess_Name()),
Beverage (with the attributes type, beverage_name and price, and the methods descr(), also it has Extras),
Dessert(attributes dessert_name and method setDessert()),
Payment(attributes pay and method, and the method pay_bill()).
Also, the Beverage is a parent for:
Coffee(attributes beans_type, coffee_type, and methods choose_bean() and choose_coffee),
Tea(attribute tea_type, and method choose()),
Cold drink (attribute cold_drink and method choose_drink())
